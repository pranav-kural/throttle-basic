# Throttle Web Framework
It's a CSS framework that works online. It enables developers to create more complex and interactive web components, more quickly and with more ease, by providing them with a basic editable structure for any component. 

  1. First Developer choose a component, like Navigation bar, then choose sub-category (if any) like circular navigation or sticky nav bar.
  2. Then the chosen compenent is opened in the developement mode, on the web page itself. This mode basically have two views, one to view the final product and the other with the coding behind it, which could be edited to make changes to the component. 
  3. After developer has made changes as he wanted, he can simply click on "Done", and choose from various options available for integrating the component into his project. Option may be to get the css code, a separate css file for the component, a minified verison of the css code or file, or add the component's css into the developer's main CSS file on the Throttle Website.
  4. Developer can choose to save the component for use in future, or may choose not to retain it (default). He can even choose to publish his component onto Throttle websphere, if he wish to.
  
##It's a quick and easy way to create awesome CSS.
